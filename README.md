## Investigating Retrieval Augmented Generation for Virtual Adaptive Tutors

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) provides a critical segue between LLM retraining and knowledge enhancement by allowing external data sources to be referred by the response generating LLM without any parametrization, thus improving the reliability, context-awareness and transparency of the generation process. We are motivated by the potential use of virtual adaptive tutor systems in school classrooms, which requires constant updation of the tutorâ€™s knowledge base and accountability for replies provided to students based on textbook resources, which makes RAG an effective solution. We first implement popular RAG systems in increasing order of complexity, moving from purely vector-based systems to graph-based systems. Our primary contribution is an external RAG system-specific evaluation pipeline, that provides a quantitative basis of comparison between the different systems within a specific domain. The evaluation pipeline fulfills a need in existing literature, since we were unable to find a domain-specific RAG evaluation suite that could be adapted to different domains of implementation. We provide a dataset suite that suits the requirements of an education domain and a simple algorithm to evaluate any RAG system.
